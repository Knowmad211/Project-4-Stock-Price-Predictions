- The model utilizes data retrieved from SQL or Spark 
- The model demonstrates meaningful predictive power at least 75% classification accuracy or 0.80 R-squared 

## Data Model Optimization
- The model optimization and evaluation process showing iterative changes made to the model and the resulting changes in model performance is documented in either a CSV/Excel table or in the Python script itself
- Overall model performance is printed or displayed at the end of the script

## Benefits
-
