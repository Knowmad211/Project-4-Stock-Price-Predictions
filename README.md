## Objective
- Forecast stock prices for our 10 specified companies using historical data and market indicators
- Provide into potential future trends based on predictive modeling techniques

## Data Model Implementation (25 points)
- A Python script initializes, trains, and evaluates a model 
- The data is cleaned, normalized, and standardized prior to modeling
- The model utilizes data retrieved from SQL or Spark 
- The model demonstrates meaningful predictive power at least 75% classification accuracy or 0.80 R-squared 

## Data Model Optimization
- The model optimization and evaluation process showing iterative changes made to the model and the resulting changes in model performance is documented in either a CSV/Excel table or in the Python script itself
- Overall model performance is printed or displayed at the end of the script

## Benefits
-
